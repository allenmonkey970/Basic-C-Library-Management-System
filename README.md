# Library Management System

This is a basic library management system implemented in C++. The system allows you to add books to the library and display their details. The project can be extended to include additional features such as reading book data from a CSV file and adding functionalities for book lookup and online checkout.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- C++ Standard Library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd library-management-system
    ```

2. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ -o library_management_system main.cpp book_system.cpp
    ```

### Usage

1. Run the compiled executable:

    ```bash
    ./library_management_system
    ```

2. The program will add a book to the library and display its details:

    ```
    Title: 1984
    Author: George Orwell
    ISBN: 9780451524935
    Year: 1949
    ```

### Extending the Project

Plans on extending this library management system by implementing the following features:

1. **Reading Books from a CSV File:**
    - Create a function to read book data from a CSV file and add the books to the library.
    
2. **Book Lookup:**
    - Implement functions to search for books in the library by title, author, or ISBN.

3. **Online Checkout:**
    - Add functionality to allow users to check out books online.
